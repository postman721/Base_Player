Building:


Generally, you should be good to go when you install something like this:


sudo yum install qt5-qtmultimedia-devel qt5-qtbase-devel .


Also, be sure to install Qtcreator (qtcreator package) because you need to  build the project with it. 

For optimal usage install pulseaudio and pulseaudio-utils.
